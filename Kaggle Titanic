Analysing titanic dataset have to predict how many passengers are survived or not,here used machine learning to create a model 
that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Data Handling:-

Importing Data with Pandas
Cleaning Data,Data wrangling
Exploring Data through Visualizations with Seaborn


Mostly Used Python Libraries in Notebook:-

Used pandas for data manipulation
Used matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
USed scikit-learn to build models 

Data Analysis:-
